# üå≥ Parks and Recreation SQL Analysis  

This SQL project explores a fictional **Parks and Recreation employee dataset**. Using structured queries, I analyzed demographics, salaries, and departmental distribution to extract meaningful business insights.  

---

## üìÅ Dataset Overview  

The database contains three main tables:  

- **employee_demographics**: employee_id, first_name, last_name, gender, age  
- **employee_salary**: employee_id, job_title, salary, dept_id  
- **parks_departments**: department_id, department_name  

---

## üéØ Objectives  

The main goals of this project were to:  
- Strengthen SQL querying skills  
- Analyze HR-style data (demographics, salaries, departments)  
- Answer business-style questions useful for workforce planning
